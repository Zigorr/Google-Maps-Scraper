‚Ä¢ "massage therapy in Clarksville TN"
‚Ä¢ "pet grooming in Hendersonville TN"
‚Ä¢ "cleaning services in Brentwood TN"
```

### **Why These Work Better:**

- **Local businesses** less likely to have professional websites

### **Expected Results:**
- **Service businesses in smaller cities**: 30-60% qualification rate
- **Personal services**: 25-50% qualification rate
- **Major cities**: Lower qualification rates (more established businesses)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Slow startup**: First run may take 10-15 seconds to initialize
2. **No results**: Try different business types or smaller cities
3. **Chrome issues**: Ensure Chrome browser is installed and updated
4. **Antivirus warnings**: Add .exe to antivirus exceptions if needed

### **Debug Tips:**
- Start with smaller batch sizes (10-20 businesses)
