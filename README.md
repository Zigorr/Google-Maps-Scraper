## 🎯 Usage Guide & Tips

### Optimal Search Strategies
The application works best with specific business types and locations:

**✅ High Success Rate Business Types:**
- Service businesses: handyman, lawn care, cleaning services
- Personal services: massage therapy, personal trainers, pet grooming
- Food & catering: food trucks, catering services, meal prep
- Creative services: photographers, musicians, event planners

**✅ Better Location Strategies:**
- Smaller cities often have more businesses without established websites
- Try suburbs and smaller towns rather than major metropolitan areas
- Example: "Franklin TN" vs "Nashville TN"

### Example Searches for Better Results
```
• "lawn care services in Franklin TN"
• "pet grooming in Murfreesboro TN"  
• "handyman services in Clarksville TN"
• "massage therapy in Cookeville TN"
• "food trucks in Hendersonville TN"
```

### Expected Success Rates
- **Service businesses in smaller cities**: 30-60% qualification rate
- **Personal services**: 25-50% qualification rate
- **Food & catering**: 40-70% qualification rate
- **Creative services**: 20-40% qualification rate

### Why Some Searches Return No Results
If you get "No qualified leads found", it means all businesses in that search have established websites. This is common with:
- Established business types (tattoo shops, salons in major cities)
- Businesses in highly competitive markets
- Corporate chains and franchises
