- ❌ **Established Websites** - Automatically filters out businesses with custom domains

### Data Collection
For each qualified business, the tool extracts:
- Business name and contact information
- Physical address
- Website/social media presence analysis
- Booking platform identification
- Custom notes field for manual annotations

### User Experience
- **Non-Technical Interface** - Simple keyword + city input
- **Real-Time Progress** - Visual feedback during scraping process
- **One-Click Operation** - Single executable file, no installation required
- **Instant Export** - Direct CSV generation for immediate use

## 📊 Business Impact

### Efficiency Gains
- **Time Reduction**: 90%+ reduction in lead research time
